## Usage 🚀

The project is documented in a Jupyter notebook which guides you through each step:

- Begin by importing the necessary libraries which are critical for running the code.
- Load the dataset following the instructions provided, ensuring data integrity.
- Proceed with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation as described in the notebook.

## Data Preprocessing 🔄

A critical step in any machine learning pipeline, data preprocessing in this project includes:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Load Data | Ensure proper organization for effective model consumption. |
| Check Balance | Ensure a fair representation of different tumor types to avoid biases. |

## Model Training 🏋️‍♂️

The CNN is meticulously constructed and trained with the dataset:

- Various layers such as `Conv2D` for feature mapping, `MaxPooling2D` for dimensionality reduction, and `Dense` layers for classification are utilized.
- The notebook explains each layer's purpose and the reasoning behind the chosen architecture.

## Results 📊

Upon training, the model exhibits outstanding performance:

- Achieves an accuracy of 99% in detecting and classifying brain tumors, which is indicative of the model's robustness.
- Detailed performance metrics, including confusion matrices and classification reports, are provided to understand the model's efficacy better.

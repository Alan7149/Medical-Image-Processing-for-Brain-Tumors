## Installation Instructions

Before diving into the analysis, ensure your environment is set up by following these steps:

1. Verify Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file of this repository.
3. Obtain the dataset either through the provided Kaggle link or directly from the repository if included.

## Usage

The project is documented in a Jupyter notebook which guides you through each step:

- Begin by importing the necessary libraries which are critical for running the code.
- Load the dataset following the instructions provided, ensuring data integrity.
- Proceed with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation as described in the notebook.

## Data Preprocessing

A critical step in any machine learning pipeline, data preprocessing in this project includes:

- Loading the training and test data while ensuring proper organization for effective model consumption.
- Checking the balance of the data to ensure a fair representation of different tumor types, thus avoiding biases in model learning.

## Model Training

The CNN is meticulously constructed and trained with the dataset:

- Various layers such as `Conv2D` for feature mapping, `MaxPooling2D` for dimensionality reduction, and `Dense` layers for classification are utilized.
- The notebook explains each layer's purpose and the reasoning behind the chosen architecture.

## Results

Upon training, the model exhibits outstanding performance:

- Achieves an accuracy of 99% in detecting and classifying brain tumors, which is indicative of the model's robustness.
- Detailed performance metrics, including confusion matrices and classification reports, are provided to understand the model's efficacy better.

## Future Improvements

While the current model performs admirably, we're open to further enhancements:

- Fine-tuning the hyperparameters could yield even more accurate results.
- Implementing data augmentation strategies could improve the model's ability to generalize across more diverse MRI scan data.
